## Abstract
This research project aims to create a system for remote presence for users in the form of a 3D virtual avatar. It allows them to establish eye contact with their avatar. Through the use of Kinect SDK and facial landmark detection techniques, the system does full body tracking and facial expression tracking. For a more immersive experience, it makes use of virtual reality through Oculus Rift. The project is implemented in a popular game engine called Unity3D that renders the avatar and talks to the Kinect sensor. Skeleton tracking and avatar mesh deformation is done directly by the Kinect. Facial landmark detection is done by an open source library called the Deformable Shape Tracking library. Blend weights are used to alter the avatarâ€™s facial expressions and successfully mirror the user.
